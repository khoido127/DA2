                        Palladium shoes accompanied the Legion's forces as they carried the banner for French values around the world. Why Palladium more than any other brand ? Because our boots are sturdy but light, water-resistant, and were the first ones made from canvas, the fastest fabric to dry out. <br>If their design has become timeless, it's because it responds to a fundamental need for resistance-resistance to the elements, to wear and tear, to time and trends.

                        <span class="label-content">The company was started by Adolf Dassler in his mother's house;
                            <br> he was joined by his elder brother Rudolf in 1924 under the name Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory.
                            <br> Dassler assisted in the development of spiked running shoes (spikes) for multiple athletic events. To enhance the quality of spiked athletic footwear, he transitioned from a previous model of heavy metal spikes to utilising canvas and rubber. Dassler persuaded U.S.
                            <br> sprinter Jesse Owens to use his hand made spikes at the 1936 Summer Olympics.
                            <br> In 1949,following a breakdown in the relationship between the brothers, Adolf created Adidas, and Rudolf established Puma, which became Adidas' business rival.

                        <span class="label-content">What is now Jordan has been inhabited by humans since the Paleolithic period. Three stable kingdoms emerged there at the end of the Bronze Age: Ammon, Moab and Edom.<br> Later rulers include the Nabataean Kingdom, the Roman Empire, and the Ottoman Empire. After the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottomans in 1916 during World War I, the Ottoman Empire was partitioned by Britain and France.
                            <br> The Emirate of Transjordan was established in 1921 by the Hashemite, then Emir, Abdullah I, and the emirate became a British protectorate. In 1946, Jordan became an independent state officially known as the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan, but was renamed in 1949 to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan after the country captured the West Bank during the 1948 Arabâ€“Israeli War and annexed it until it was lost to Israel in 1967.
